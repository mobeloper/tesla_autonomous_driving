# Project: Tesla Autonomous Driving

## Overview
Autonomous vehicles (AV) and intelligent transport systems (ITS) are the future of road 
transport. Automatic detection of vehicles on the road in real-time helps AV technology 
and makes ITS more intelligent in terms of vehicle tracking, vehicle counting, and road 
incident response.

Tesla, Inc. is an American multinational automotive and artificial intelligence company. 
In October 2020, Tesla started a full self-driving capability beta program in the United 
States. Tesla has over 100k people in this program.

This project has 2 objectives:

### Objective 1
The first objective is to develop an AI model using a deep learning framework that predicts the type of vehicle present in an image as well as localizing the vehicle by rectangular bounding box.

### Objective 2
Analyze the usage of self-driving capability and its effect on road safety.


## Datasets
The images dataset includes pictures taken from autonomous vehicles, traffic cameras, and public surveillance cameras.
